# Building Your Story

All the power for developing your non-linear narrative rests inside a JSON based script file.  
  
You could also define separate scripts for mobile and desktop (you will have to pass in the correct script into LoomSE).

You can view an [example script](script-example.json) to give you an idea of how to structure your JSON.

Please refer to the [script schema](schemas/script.json).  

You can use the above schema with a validation tool such as AJV, to validate your JSON.

## Checklist

✔️ Video assets in one or more formats

## Adding a scene to the story script
In LoomSE, videos are organised in "scenes". Before adding your video, you must create a scene.

You can only provide 1 video per scene, but you can supply that video in multiple formats (for example `mp4`, `ogg` or `webm`).

In the following example, we create one scene called "intro":

```json
"scenes": {
  "intro": {
    "longName": "",
    "video": {
      "autoplay": true,
      "muted": true,
      "sources": {
        "mp4": "intro.mp4"
      }
    },
    "events": []
  }
}
```

A scene must include a video and a have an events property (even if it is empty).

## Adding an event to a scene
Events are added as an array of objects. The following is an example of one event:

```json
[
    {
      "group": "skipTo",
      "in": 6000,
      "out": 6000,
      "payload": {
        "nextScene": "farmhack"
      }
    }
]
```

`group` - refers to a non-unique value which designates that this event is of a certain type. Use this property to categorise your events.

`in` - refers to the start time of the event (in milliseconds)

`out` - refers to the stop time of the event (in milliseconds)

`payload` - a user defined object

## Example use
In the following example, we will define 2 scenes.

The first scene will refer to the second scene via an event.

```json
"scenes": {
    "intro": {
      "longName": "",
      "video": {
        "autoplay": true,
        "muted": true,
        "sources": {
          "mp4": "intro.mp4"
        }
      },
      "events": [
        {
          "group": "skipTo",
          "in": 5000,
          "out": 5000,
          "payload": {
            "nextScene": "phone-call"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    "phone-call": {
      "longName": "",
      "video": {
        "autoplay": true,
        "muted": true,
        "sources": {
          "mp4": "phone-call.mp4"
        }
      },
      "events": []
    }
  }
```

To have loomse act on the data in the event, you will need to listen and respond to the events generated in the DOM. By taking control of how these events are handled, you can build rich and complex interactive systems. Learn more about this in our [Getting Started](GETTING_STARTED.md) guide.
